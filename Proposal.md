# Proposal: Video Game Sales

## Motivation & Purpose
**Our role:** market analytics consultants
**Target audience:** gaming industry investors and developers

The video game industry has experienced unprecedented growth over the last 10 years. It has progressed from a niche market within the entertainment sector to a colossal industry with revenues greater than both the film and sports industries combined! In this environment there are a lot of interested parties looking to catch the rising tide. However, as with any multi-billion-dollar market, there is a tremendous amount of information to distill and it can be challenging to ‘see the forest through the trees’. To address this challenge, we propose the creation of a dashboard app that will allow relative newcomers to the industry to quickly and easily gain a high-level understanding of the market landscape. Our dashboard will allow users to view the sales revenue of various regions while filtering by gaming industry subsectors and genres.

## Description of the data
The video game sales data set contains games that had more than 100K copies sold. The game release year variable allows us to plot trends in the data. These trends and other visualizations help us compare and contrast genres, publishers, and platforms. The total sales of these games in their release year help us compare and contrast sales across different regions such as Europe, North America, and Japan. Other variables in the data that we intend to look at include the ranking of the games by sales as well as the global sales of the games. Overall, this seems to be a rich data set that will allow us to explore the research questions and usage scenarios described below.

## Research questions and usage scenarios
Gordon is a pretty savvy investor with many years of experience outside of the gaming industry. He wants to identify promising new gaming developers in which to buy equity but is unsure of where to begin. With dozens of genres and hundreds of studios the task seems quite daunting. Gordon wants to be able to **explore** the industry from a high level while **filtering** by subsectors and product types in order to identify pockets with the highest investment potential. It is not required that the information be comprehensive enough to conduct a full financial analysis, only that it is enough to bring out key highlights and areas of interest. When Gordon logs on to the “game_sales” dashboard he is presented with several charts and an accompanying set of filters. By applying the filters Gordon is able to see the sales breakdowns of various regions by publisher, genre, platform and even release year. After a short exploration Gordon determines that the most promising areas are PS3 Shooter and Xbox Sports games.
